For the progam to work, what you set as the file directory needs to contain a file called apiKeys.txt which has the discord bot you are usings apiKey and your openAi key in the first and second line respectivly
(I know this sucks but when I made it I hard coded the keys and I didnt want to actually do anything before putting it online)
